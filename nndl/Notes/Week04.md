# Deep Neural Networks
Understand the key computations underlying deep learning, use them to build and train deep neural networks, and apply it to computer vision.
## Learning Objectives
- See deep neural networks as successive blocks put one after each other
- Build and train a deep L-layer Neural Network
- Analyze matrix and vector dimensions to check neural network implementations.
- Understand how to use a cache to pass information from forward propagation to back propagation.
- Understand the role of hyperparameters in deep learning
